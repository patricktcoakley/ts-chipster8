# ts-chipster8
Just a quick port of [Chipster8](https://github.com/patricktcoakley/Chipster8).

## Usage
This project uses Parcel, so all that needs to be done is:
* `npm i`
* `npm run dev` for local development
* `npm run build` to build

## Notes
* The `y`, `u`, and `i` keys can be used to dump the memory, registers, and video, respectively.
